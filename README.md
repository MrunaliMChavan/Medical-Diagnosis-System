Using machine learning algorithms, the Medical Diagnosis System is an innovative tool that uses predictive analysis to identify and diagnose common health conditions including diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. This system helps healthcare professionals and individuals make informed decisions by providing accurate predictions based on patient data.

Models for Predicting Disease: Three machine learning models are included in the system, each one customized for a particular health condition:

1. Cancer Prediction: Predicts cancer risk using the Naive Bayes algorithm, which is perfect for handling datasets with independent information.

2. Diabetes Prediction: This technique efficiently manages non-linear interactions by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to categorize diabetes risk based on a variety of patient data.

3. Heart Disease Prediction: By examining important health markers, Logistic Regression is used to estimate the risk of heart disease.

Data Preparation: The system collects data from reliable sources, followed by preprocessing steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical data to ensure accuracy in predictions.

Web Application Interface: Developed using Streamlit, the application provides an intuitive interface where users can input health data and receive real-time predictions.

Model Serialization and Deployment: Models are serialized for quick loading and use within the Streamlit application. The app is deployed on Streamlit's cloud service, ensuring easy access for users worldwide.
